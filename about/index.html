			Actually, the target audience for my offered services would be students.

			I usually get paid fair amount, and I really don't charge that much.

	Hi! I’m Jane Ann. Gryffindor, from District Thirteen. I’m a divergent. I’m still an eighteen-year-old college girl at the moment. I had this great like for Taylor Swift, which is the reason I got my curls. When I lack in sleep, my body always starts acting like a drunk kid.  I don’t get out of the house when I haven’t taken my bath yet, even though someone was waiting for me. I find taking care of wild pigs, baby carabaos and ponies cute. I love cats and dogs and cute fluffy chicks. I love the moon. The moon itself and the person I see in it. I hate the dark. I’m afraid of ghost, heights, turkeys and still wondering where my prince charming is. I find breaking parallels in a sentence cute. I don’t drink coffee and I believe in the saying that time is gold. I am a daddy’s girl and liked to lie about me being pretty. I can’t let a day pass without listening to music. I love playing guitar and piano keyboards, and always dreamt of having my own skate board. I love to write. I’m a chocoholic and proud of it. I often write nonsense stuffs like this and end up laughing at it. I tried to write a book three times, but always failed. I recently realized I’m always busy doing nothing. I like hanging out with my girl friends and doing things for the first time. I love Sidney Sheldon and read almost half of his published books. I’m not bookish but I’m a bookworm. I am a positive person but don’t have trust for myself. I say ‘pineapple’ when someone is about to sneeze, hold my tongue when I’m sleepy, and hold my breath when I have hiccups. One day I’ll go to Paris with my best friend, which was the original plan, but was somehow changed to me traveling there alone. I love white roses and pink daisies. I have never seen a snow and always liked the rain more than sunshine even though I easily suffer from cold. I’m a family and friendship-oriented person. I am a good programmer as what have my friends told me, but still don’t believe it. I was bullied a lot of times. I easily cry when I was in high school, and now I don’t. I was born autumn equinox, ninth month of the year, four days before the month ends. I have given up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter when I was young. I love watching movies. I love staying up too late, regretting it when I woke up in the morning and do it again at night. I studied reading people’s mind and studied lucid dreaming to fly in my dreams. I had a crush on this boy which I thought was my first love when I was third year high school that lasted until I was third year college. Found out he was a total jerk. I don’t like being cut offed when I am telling stories. I fell in love once, heart broken twice, with the same person and I never regretted it. I love dipping Mcdo Fries into Coke Mcfloat, as well as Tortillos in a cookies n’ cream ice cream. I had managed to put up hundreds and thousands of my very own concert which varies in different locations, such as the bathroom, my room, and on phone. I’m the game maker of the flock. I have a J-shaped birthmark on my left thigh, and a small mole near my lips. I had this weird dimple that was placed below my eye, on my right cheek bone. I like to use the 24-hour time system. I hate Math. I cannot answer in ten seconds if you asked me what 6+8 is. I had my hair cut only once since I’ve been to college. I like speed. I always create  bracelets from my used earphones. I dreamt of being the President of the Philippines, but I hate politics. I hate hearing the sound of my recorded voice. I never liked taking medicines when I’m sick which happens only once in a blue moon. I’m a sentimental person but can let go of the past. I take life as a game to be played. I love Europe. I’d like to see Neuchswanstein from a helicopter. I promised to marry a guy who don’t even like me. I love surprises. I always believed I have a lucky charm in my blood. I’m careless but was always far from accidents. I’m easily attracted to guys with abs. I have this weird happiness when I have a cutter which I do not intend on wounding anything or anyone. I used to wound myself when I’m in pain, but stopped doing it since someone literally wounded herself to stop me. I never tasted alcohol in my whole life, except for the wine where we dipped the holy bread (body of Jesus) on my fourth year recollection. Before, I can’t sleep by myself on a doubles bed, but now, I can’t sleep when I share it with someone. I always utter a wish when the time is 11:11. I cry over Titanic everytime I watch it. I fell out of love for Taylor Swift once because of someone who fell in love with her because of me and was now still in love with her because of someone else. I find Windows 8 neat and fluid. I want to be multi-lingual so I tried studying Spanish, Japanese, Hangeul, French, but I end up knowing C, ASP.NET, VB.NET, HTML, CSS, PHP and stuff. I can’t vandal on school property with my tag name ‘exileprincess’ because a lot of person knows it was me, including my professors. I’d love to try ending my written stuffs in the middle of a sentence. It feels like
