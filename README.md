Hi! This is Jahna, I'm trying to create a personal webpage here. <br/>

I'm planning to create a personal webpage that will be coded, without using open source content management system. <br/>
I'm planning to create the CMS part of the page through PHP coding.

Target Features <br/>
  CMS for blogs and portfolio <br/>
  small e-commerce part for the services page (target are students having difficulties in their computer subjects) <br/>
  and more
  
Started to create the webpage on May 16, 2016 and still on going.

This page will be messy, please bear with me since I'm still learning. <br/>
I'm eager to learn more about web developing.

Goodluck with me! Haha
