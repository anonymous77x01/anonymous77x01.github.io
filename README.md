Hi! This is Jahna, I'm trying to create a personal webpage here. 

I'm planning to create a personal webpage that will be coded, without using open source content management system.
I'm planning to create the CMS part of the page through PHP coding.

Target Features
  CMS for blogs and portfolio
  small e-commerce part for the services page (target are students having difficulties in their computer subjects)
  and more
  
Started to create the webpage on May 16, 2016 and still on going.

This page will be messy, please bear with me since I'm still learning.
I'm eager to learn more about web developing.

Goodluck with me! Haha
